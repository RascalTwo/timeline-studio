# private trunk, public drop — pre-push guard.
#
# The invariant this enforces: everything public is ONE parentless (orphan) commit.
# `private/trunk` holds the real history and is never pushed; `main` is a fresh
# orphan snapshot force-pushed over the last one.
#
# Three independent checks, cheapest first:
#   1. name    — refuse any ref under private/          (blocks the obvious mistake)
#   2. shape   — commit must have no parents            (blocks publishing real history)
#   3. content — tree must not match drop.blockPaths    (blocks publishing the wrong tree)
#
# Checks 2 and 3 are NOT redundant. A repo whose public branch is a subset of the
# working tree (e.g. main is README-only) can produce a parentless commit that
# still contains everything — shape passes, content catches it. Set the posture
# explicitly per repo, never inferred:
#
#   git config drop.blockPaths '^(viz-pages|repo-issue-scanner)/'
#
# Unset drop.blockPaths = full-tree posture (ai-setup, explorables, timeline-studio).
# Deliberate override: git push --no-verify
#
# LOCAL ONLY (.git/hooks, per-clone). Reinstall with scripts/install-hooks.sh.
